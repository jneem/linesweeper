# linesweeper: a robust sweep-line algorithm

This rust crate implements a "robust" version of the Bentley-Ottmann sweep-line
algorithm, and uses it to provide various two-dimensional geometric primitives
like boolean operations on sets bounded by BÃ©zier paths.
It is currently in a pre-alpha state.
