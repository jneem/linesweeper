/// Describes the interaction between a line segment and a sweep-line.
///
/// In exact math, a non-horizontal line segment can interact with a sweep-line
/// in exactly one way: by intersecting it at a point. When dealing with inexact
/// math, intersections and re-orderings between line segments might force
/// our sweep-line algorithm to perturb the line segment. In that case, even
/// a non-horizontal line segment might enter and leave the sweep-line at two
/// different points.
///
/// `OutputEvent` is ordered by the smallest horizontal coordinate where
/// it intersects the sweep-line (i.e. [`OutputEvent::smaller_x`]).
///
/// The two points, `x0` and `x1`, are in sweep-line order. This doesn't
/// necessarily mean that `x0` is smaller than `x1`! Instead, it means that
/// when traversing the segment in sweep-line order (i.e. in increasing `y`,
/// and increasing `x` if the segment is horizontal) then it visits `x0`
/// before `x1`.
